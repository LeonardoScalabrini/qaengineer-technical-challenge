# QUESTIONS

1. Is there a minimum and/or maximum character limit for the strings?
2. Should we consider uppercase and lowercase vowels and consonant?
3. Does the string allow numbers and special characters?
4. Should be able to add 3 strings or less at once?
5. How should we display the number of vowels and consonant in each string? I know it should follow the order in which the strings are provided, but could you provide more details? (Here would suggest "draw" some examples of input and output)
